# IncrementalListView
I created this control to extend the capabilities of the ListView control in Xamarin.Forms and added the Incremental scrolling feature (Infinite Scroll) with minimal dependencies.
# Usage:
You can use this control as a normal ListView with all its capabilities. But to use the Incremental Loading feature you have to provide an implementation of the interface IIncrementalSource as the source of paging data.
